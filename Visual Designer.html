        <p>This role is very important in order to build the best design team.
Also called graphic designers, visual designers are responsible for choosing and ordering elements, like images, colors, symbols and typography, to express a message to people.<br><br>
Over the past few years, with the advancement of mobile design, increased browser capabilities and responsive design, the visual designer role has changed.<br><br>
An absolute must is that these designers are creative and able to create solutions.<br><br>
A graphic designer these days has to create visual components and systems that, together, are dynamic in nature. This has caused the gap between the multifaceted designer, who is able to work on screen and print, and a designer who is specialist in nature — they work on mobile or web designs and are well acquainted with visual design that is interactive for the user.<br><br>
Lately, there has also been a development in which these designers undertake a front-end developer role; however, this happens mostly when the interaction on the project isn’t heavy and where JavaScript is less important than cascading style sheets (CSS).<br><br>
The most common outputs from the visual or graphic designer are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Design composition and rules;</li>
    <li>Grid systems;</li>
    <li>Iconography;</li>
    <li>Style guides and tiles;</li>
    <li>Mood boards</li>
    <li>Typography</li>
</ul>

<p>It is key to recruit visual designers that have a strong interaction focus; whether they are self-taught or studied design.<br><br>

Moreover, the person who fulfills this role needs to be able to work with the tools and methods that are utilized in the execution of front-end developers, particularly when responsive techniques and CSS3 are involved.<br><br>

Graphic designers need to be more than capable to design systems on screens that are static. For example <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-microinteractions-9456211aeed0#.2v7y754u7">microinteraction</a> dealing with  will be a key skill to have.
