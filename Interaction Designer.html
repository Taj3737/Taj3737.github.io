        <h1>5- Interaction Designer</h1>

<p>The interaction designer is responsible for creating and changing things that are digital so that people can use it. It deals more with the behavior of these digital things and the look of it.<br><br>


Furthermore, the effort for interaction designers focuses on the flow and sequence together with the layout and form.<br><br>


Candidates who are purely interaction designers are not common; most often, it is the front-end programmers or visual designers that possess these skills.<br><br>


Outputs that these designers deliver are:<br>

<ul>
    <li>Wireframess;</li>
    <li>Site Strcutures</li>
    <li>Concespt descriptions;</li>
    <li>Desired system behavior descriptions.</li>
</ul>

Strong communication skills must be looked out for as the deliverables are interconnected with the final project delivery. <a href="https://designexcellent.com/how-providing-ux-in-agile-ux-design-lead-product-owner/">Especially in agile projects</a>  does this role enable both communication and production.<br><br>


If you want to hire an Interaction Designer just keep in mind that you need someone with, at least, 2 years of experience in this role. And also it is very important that an Interaction Designer have both UX and UI skills
