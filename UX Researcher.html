<p>This role is responsible for collecting insights into the user, as the userâ€™s needs need to be detailed. As the project progresses, user testing, including other user-orientated activities that tests design, content and level of interaction, will be done by the user researcher.<br><br>


The user could be customers (new or existing), employees, partner or supplier (B2B), or a visitor to a website.<br><br>

As the user researcher has become more of its own role, so has it grown with popularity.<br><br>

There are three factors that have had an effect on this role: design that is data driven,service design and lean startup.<br><br>

Not only are qualitative techniques used, but quantitative ones as well. The latter includes Web Analytics, <a href="https://designexcellent.com/use-ab-testing-to-increase-conversion-rates/">A/B Testing</a> advanced surveying and eye tracking.<br><br>

As such, user researchers need to be able to work with statistics. On a big user experience team, the capacity is there to have some people dedicated for working with data that is quantitative in nature while others can work with qualitative data.<br><br>

While some companies do not want user researchers who focus solely on user needs, there is a case to be made that companies would want designers that have a background in researching user needs.<br><br>

The reason for this is that information can be lost when the data is handed over from the researcher to the designer, and the research is about both inspiration and insight. Thus, these companies need to make sure that all the members on the design team are capable enough in user research.<br><br>

The typical outputs from user research are:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>User stories and requirements;</li>
    <li>Service blueprints;</li>
    <li>Customer journey maps;</li>
    <li>Mental models as well as personas.</li>
</ul>
