        <h1>6- UX Lead</h1>

<p>As the role name suggests, the experience lead supplies that leadership aspect that the design team needs.<br><br>


The team needs a dedicated leader who can ensure that the team moves in the right direction.<br><br>


Unlike all the other roles, this one has no direct outputs other than the end product. In order to succeed in the vision of the project and get to the end result, the experience lead role may require a lot of communication with the team, facilitation and even decision making.
The experience lead should have enough skills and experience in order to fill the other roles as well (or some of them), so the person would not be solely responsible for leading the team.<br><br>


One skill is very important to have: a good predisposition for business, as it is the spokesperson for the team in relation to the team’s relationship with the leaders of the company. Mentoring is another nice to have skill.<br><br>

Furthermore, the line becomes obscured between user and customer experience with regard to the experience lead.

<b>Conclusions — How to build the best Design Team</b>

<p>In order to build the best design team, companies need to know the duties and responsibilities of these professionals in order to put hiring and staffing plans into practice. Projects may require different needs and roles, so you need to make sure your team is aligned with those needs.<br><br>


It is important to have a team whose members have more than one skill. Indeed, create a team with overlapping competencies will ensure that the best UX is delivered for the user.<br><br>


As the roles on a user experience team are generally not clear or well understood, challenges result when these members are recruited and hired.
Furthermore, since every project is different and needs are not the same, together with UX roles that are not defined, it is virtually impossible to make sure that the results needed are delivered.<br><br>


In this article, I identified six of the key roles that has to be present on the design team.<br>

<ol>
    <li>Content Strategist</li>
    <li>Visual Designer</li>
    <li>User Researcher</li>
    <li>Front-End Developer</li>
    <li>Interaction Designer</li>
    <li>UX Lead</li>
</ol>
</p>


<p>It is important to note that it isn’t necessary to have 6 people on the design team, but the people on the team, whether there are 7 or 3, need to be able to carry out all of these roles. In order to have a team that fulfills all 6 roles, make use of the descriptions below.<br><br>


These are merely a guide for you to know what to look for and also who to choose to fulfill all the roles.
